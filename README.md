# Where To Watch
Whilst looking for a movie or show to watch, people are always looking for the service provider as well. This project utilizes a Streaming Availability API and renders a list of results related to the user's searches. This app was constructed in a simplistic manner so as to make the useability as easy as possible.

The app will provide the user with various amounts of options to choose from related to the type of motion picture, the service provider, and the name of the movie or show. Once finished, the app will show a list of results and the results' descriptions as well as a link to the service provider.

If the user does not have a specific movie or show in mind, they will have the option to use a randomizer that was created with a Random Word Generator API.  

_Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, React, Redux, External APIs_
